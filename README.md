# etch-a-sketch

This project was part of The Odin Project to build an Etch-a-Sketch canvas.

A prompt appears on startup asking the user to set the grid size of the canvas. The grid is generated and the user can draw on the canvas using their mouse pointer. There are event listeners that will change color when the user goes over each of the tiles. 

The user has the option to clear the canvas and create a new grid.
